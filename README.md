# Sensemaking Data Pipeline

This project involves:
- Pulling data from MIT's course catalog using Python
- Cleaning the unstructured data from the web
- Extracting the course names from the data
- Perform data analysis to learn how many times each word occurs throughout all of the course names
- The analysis will be saved as a JSON that will be referenced by my D3 web app
- The web app will generate a visual analysis of the JSON data that was collected
- Instantiate an Airflow web server within a Docker container to handle each task defined
